# CCSW 413 Software Design Patterns 2024
### Space Invaders game with applying some of the design patterns

### The pattrens applied are:
### * Singleton Pattern --> for the ship where it generates one time and then it give the same instance 
### * Prototype Pattern --> for the aliens where we make copies instead of generating new instance
### * Flyweight Pattern --> for the generated bullets we reduce the number of objects crerated 
### * Adapter Pattern --> Generated new type of bullets to excute this pattern which we call the deadly bullets and adapt 
it to work with the orginal bullets
### * State Pattern --> for the state of the game so the state changes dynamically on runtime 
### * Strategy state --> for the controls of the game which is left movement and right movment they both are ship movement strategy
